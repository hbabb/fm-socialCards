# 🌐 Social Links Profile

This is my second Frontend Mentor project — a responsive **Social Links Profile** built with **Vite** and **TailwindCSS**. The goal was to match the provided design as closely as possible while improving my modern frontend workflow.

## 🚀 About the Project

This challenge focused on building a profile card with multiple social media links, styled to match both mobile and desktop mockups. It was a great exercise in responsive design, utility-first CSS, and hover/focus interaction.

**Key Features:**

- Built using **Vite** for a fast dev environment
- Styled with **TailwindCSS**
- Mobile-first, responsive layout
- Accessible HTML structure
- Smooth hover and focus states
